      <p class="paragraph">
        I started <strong class="text-highlight">Teyvat Bulletin</strong> as a
        way to learn and improve my programming skills, particularly in Vue.js,
        since it's the framework
        <strong class="text-highlight">HoYoverse</strong> uses for their own web
        applications. I wanted to get hands-on experience with Vue while also
        experimenting with web effects and interactive UI elements to make the
        site visually engaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, I’ve always enjoyed
        <strong class="text-highlight">Genshin Impact</strong>, and I wanted to
        create a space where players can easily find character materials, weapon
        recommendations, and team compositions without having to search through
        multiple sources. My goal was to make a clean, organized, and
        user-friendly resource that helps both new and experienced players
        quickly see what they need to level up their favorite characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is a combination of my interest in programming, web design,
        and Genshin Impact, and it continues to evolve as I learn more about
        Vue, front-end development, and interactive web experiences.

          Building Teyvat Bulletin has been an exciting journey, and I’ve
          leveraged a powerful combination of modern tools and frameworks to
          bring this project to life. From crafting dynamic user interfaces with
          <strong class="text-highlight">Vue.js</strong> to managing real-time
          data seamlessly with <strong class="text-highlight">Supabase</strong>,
          each technology has played a crucial role in shaping the site’s
          functionality and design. I’ve also used
          <strong class="text-highlight">GSAP</strong> for smooth, interactive
          animations, <strong class="text-highlight">Tailwind CSS</strong> for
          rapid and responsive styling, and ldrs for sleek, customizable loading
          animations. Together, these tools have allowed me to create a fast,
          visually appealing, and user-friendly experience for Genshin Impact
          fans.

          Notable mentions: <strong class="text-highlight">Uiball</strong> for
          their ldrs (Loading/Spinner) library
