      <h1 class="title">About this project</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I started <strong class="text-highlight">Teyvat Bulletin</strong> as a
        way to learn and improve my programming skills, particularly in Vue.js,
        since it's the framework
        <strong class="text-highlight">HoYoverse</strong> uses for their own web
        applications. I wanted to get hands-on experience with Vue while also
        experimenting with web effects and interactive UI elements to make the
        site visually engaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Iâ€™ve always enjoyed
        <strong class="text-highlight">Genshin Impact</strong>, and I wanted to
        create a space where players can easily find character materials, weapon
        recommendations, and team compositions without having to search through
        multiple sources. My goal was to make a clean, organized, and
        user-friendly resource that helps both new and experienced players
        quickly see what they need to level up their favorite characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is a combination of my interest in programming, web design,
        and Genshin Impact, and it continues to evolve as I learn more about
        Vue, front-end development, and interactive web experiences.
