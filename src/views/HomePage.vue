          Hey there, Traveler! Teyvat Bulletin is a simple, fan-made space where
          I share character builds, team compositions, and tips for Genshin
          Impact. This isn't a pro-level guideâ€”just a fun project where I
          explore different playstyles and showcase builds that have worked for
          me.

            Character Builds â€“ Recommended weapons, artifacts, and talent
            priorities.

          <li>
            Team Ideas â€“ Synergies that can help in different parts of the game.

            A Learning Journey â€“ Just like you, Iâ€™m always experimenting and
